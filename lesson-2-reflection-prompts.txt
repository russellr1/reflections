How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a preparatory area for completed work, but a step before an actual commit.
It allows a batch of changes to be uploaded, just as git expects.

Save your changes, but to commit it does not pick from working directory so upload change into staging area and then commit.
This helps with the one logical change per commit.
