How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The changes can be seen clearly, when the code changes in each file are kept side by side.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Similar comparisons can make the programmer aware of the most common mistakes being made. Also having the entire history can help in reverting to an older version of the code when required.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - No need to have an unnecessary number of versions.
    Cons - A system crash could result in local changes being lost.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    No idea.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git Log helps walk through a list where details are provided for each version
    Git Diff evaluates the difference between 2 version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
